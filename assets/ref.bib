abstract = {The multipole expansion is an approximation technique useful whenever one wishes to obtain the electromagnetic fields far away from the sources. Here we present an alternative way to perform the multipole expansion which is more economic than usual treatments, specially in time-dependent situations. This method is based on a Taylor expansion directly on the sources (charge and current distributions), instead of the usually performed expansion on the fields. We apply this source method to calculate explicitly the complete fields of an arbitrary time dependent point magnetic dipole and point electric quadrupole.}

In this paper, we show how to derive the complete pure spinor AdS5×S5 superstring sigma-model from 4DCS theory with defects. The matter sector of this sigma model was previously derived by Costello and Yamazaki, and we propose here that the pure spinor ghosts come from gauge-fixing meromorphic transformations of 4DCS which lead to the usual pure spinor Lax connection including the ghost contribution.}

The main purpose is to provide a model that can mimic the properties of photonic or phononic crystals. This system displays frequency intervals for which wave propagation is not allowed (frequency bandgaps), in close analogy to photonic and phononic crystals. We discuss the behavior of these bandgaps when varying physical parameters, such as the values of the linear mass densities, the oscillation frequency, and the number of string segments constituting the entire system.}",

	abstract = {There are holographic superconformal theories in all dimensions between two and six which allow arbitrary tree-level four-point functions to be fixed by basic consistency conditions. Although Mellin space is usually the most efficient setting for imposing these contraints, four-point functions in two dimensions have thus far been an exception due to their more intricate dependence on the conformal cross-ratios. In this paper, we introduce a simple fix which exploits the relation between a parity-odd conformal block in two dimensions and a parity-even conformal block in four dimensions. We then apply the resulting toolkit to a study of the paradigmatic holographic theory in two dimensions which is the D1-D5 CFT. For correlators involving Kaluza-Klein modes of the tensor multiplet, this analysis reproduces results which were previously obtained using hidden conformal symmetry. With four Kaluza-Klein modes of the graviton multiplet, it yields new results including a compact formula for the correlators of all pairwise identical operators.},
