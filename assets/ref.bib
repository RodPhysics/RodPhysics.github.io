abstract = {The multipole expansion is an approximation technique useful whenever one wishes to obtain the electromagnetic fields far away from the sources. Here we present an alternative way to perform the multipole expansion which is more economic than usual treatments, specially in time-dependent situations. This method is based on a Taylor expansion directly on the sources (charge and current distributions), instead of the usually performed expansion on the fields. We apply this source method to calculate explicitly the complete fields of an arbitrary time dependent point magnetic dipole and point electric quadrupole.}

  abstract = {Four-dimensional Chern-Simons (4DCS) theory is useful for understanding integrable sigma-models and constructing new ones. In this paper, we show how to derive the complete pure spinor AdS5Ã—S5 superstring sigma-model from 4DCS theory with defects. The matter sector of this sigma model was previously derived by Costello and Yamazaki, and we propose here that the pure spinor ghosts come from gauge-fixing meromorphic transformations of 4DCS which lead to the usual pure spinor Lax connection including the ghost contribution.}

The main purpose is to provide a model that can mimic the properties of photonic or phononic crystals. This system displays frequency intervals for which wave propagation is not allowed (frequency bandgaps), in close analogy to photonic and phononic crystals. We discuss the behavior of these bandgaps when varying physical parameters, such as the values of the linear mass densities, the oscillation frequency, and the number of string segments constituting the entire system.}",
