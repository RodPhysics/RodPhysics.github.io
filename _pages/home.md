### Welcome!

My name is Rodrigo Schmidt Pitombo, I was born in 1999 in Rio de Janeiro. At some point in my life, I noticed that I needed to understand the universe on a deeper level. This naturally led me to Physics. I am a graduate student (PhD) in the Institute of Theoretical Physics at Unesp and completed a BSc in Physics at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

### Research interests:
My main interests are string theory, conformal field theories, supersymmetry and quantum field theory in general. In particular, most of what I've been doing relates to the AdS-CFT duality, a correspondence between a field theory (usually conformal) in a d-dimensional flat space and a string theory in a d+1-dimensional Anti-De Sitter space. This duality is fascinating as it, in principle, allows us to access strong-coupling physics on one side by considering the weakly interacting regime on the other. More specifically, I'm interested in bootstrap methods to compute observables (i.e. correlators) in holographic theories and in better understanding the pure spinor formalism in AdS5, which is a worldsheet description for superstrings in this background.
